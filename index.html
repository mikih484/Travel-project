            <h2>Why Bratislava?</h2>
            <h3>Bratislava, "Little Big City"</h3>
            <p>
              Bratislava, the capital and largest city of Slovakia, is a
              charming, compact city located on the Danube River at the border
              with Austria and Hungary. Known for its pedestrian-only medieval
              Old Town, hilltop castle, and vibrant café culture, it features a
              unique mix of gothic, baroque, and communist-era
              architecture.Often called "Little Big City," it offers a relaxed,
              walkable experience compared to neighboring capitals. The city
              hosts various events, including the Bratislava Spring Music
              Festival and Uprising Festival. A compact Danube-side gem ideal
              for a 1-2 day trip.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bratislava is rich in folklore, featuring legends about giant
              wizards (Klingsor) turning the castle into a table, a maiden
              falling for an enemy Turkish chief, and a massive snake drinking
              blood beneath the castle. Famous city legends include a
              love-struck Napoleonic soldier, the ghost of a tragic maiden at
              Devin Castle, and a knight whose song inspired a magical fountain.
